; Normally only the last human player in a hotseat game gets to see the AIs move their units since the game processes the interturn while that player
; is still seated. This setting shows the AI moves to the other players in the game. It works by creating a save just before the interturn processing
; happens and then, at the start of the other players' turns, loads the save, sets that player as the seated one, reprocesses the interturn, then
; resumes the original game.

; The game rules do not permit aircraft in an airfield to be damaged by bombardment. The interface allows players to order such bombardments anyway

; airfield which would have no effect.
disallow_useless_bombard_vs_airfields = true

; This option fixes a graphical bug that appears when the game is run on Linux using Wine. The bug is caused by the game using both Windows GDI and
; OpenGL to draw to the same canvas. Because the game only uses OpenGL to draw lines, it's relatively easy to solve this issue by reimplementing line
; drawing using Windows GDI+ instead. There are three possible settings for this option:
;   never: Self-explanatory
;   wine: This change will only be applied if the mod detects the game is running on Wine
;   always: This change will always be applied, even on an actual Windows system

; Causes the domestic advisor to ask for confirmation before setting city production to a building that would replace another already built in the

[=== OPTIMIZATION ===]
[====================]

; Rewrites parts of the game logic to improve efficiency. Those parts check every possible improvement defined in the scenario when they really only

; majority of them do not enable air trade. This option can improve turn times very significantly in some circumstances.
optimize_improvement_loops = true

; Displays a popup after each turn has been processed showing the time elapsed, including specifically how much time was spent recomputing trade
; networks. NOTE: Turning this on will skip all animations during the interturn so they don't contribute to the time. You aren't meant to play the

; Allows artillery unit AI to grab escorts from city defenders, causing the AI to use its artillery offensively instead of leaving it in its cities.
use_offensive_artillery_ai = true

; If true, the AI will not escort its units unless they have the "requires escort" flag set in the editor. This allows modders to remove the escort
; requirement from certain types of units, for example artillery with non-zero defense.
dont_escort_unflagged_units = false

; Set to a number to encourage the AI to build more artillery, set to false or <= 0 for no change in AI unit build choices. The number is how many
; artillery units the AI will try to keep around for every 100 non-artillery combat land units it has. The encouragement only applies if the AI is
; already above a minimum of one defensive unit per city and one offensive unit per two cities. Default: 16.
ai_build_artillery_ratio = 16

; The above option controls how many artillery the AI will keep around, this one controls how aggressively it builds up to that limit. More
; specifically it controls how valuable (in percent) the AI thinks artillery is as a damage dealer compared to attacking units. Default: 50.
ai_artillery_value_damage_percent = 50

; Like the artillery ratio, shifts the AI's build priority from fighters to bombers to keep around this many bombers per 100 fighters. Default: 70.
ai_build_bomber_ratio = 70

; Completely replaces the leader unit AI with custom code. The custom version is similar in spirit to the original but fixes several major issues:
; 1. It fixes a bug that allowed the AI to rush any kind of city production, including units and (with an MGL) wonders
; 2. Prioritizes army formation over rushing production when appropriate
; 3. When rushing, prioritizes wonders and costly improvements in high value cities
replace_leader_unit_ai = true

; Replaces the AI code that determines whether a unit would be a good addition to an army. The replacement code fixes a major bug that prevented the
; AI from filling its armies, prevents the AI from including hidden nationality units in armies to avoid crashes, and removes some logic that
; encouraged the AI to mix unit types in armies.
fix_ai_army_composition = true

; "Pop units" are special units whose only purpose is to be joined into cities to increase their population. Normally the AI does not know what to do
; with these units, so this option enables a routine that causes them to search for & join an appropriate city. Pop units only appear in some mods
; (for example Tides of Crimson). Under the standard game rules, this option has no effect. In order to function as a pop unit, a unit must use the
; terraform AI strategy, have no worker actions except join city, have a pop cost of at least 1, and have zero attack, defense, & bombard strengths.
enable_pop_unit_ai = true

; "Caravan units" are special units whose only purpose is to be disbanded to contribute shields to a city. The name comes from the Civ 2 caravan.
; Caravan units may appear in some mods; under the standard game rules, this option has no effect. In order to function as a caravan unit, a unit must
; use the terraform AI strategy, have no worker actions enabled, have the ability to disband, and have zero attack, defense, & bombard strengths.
enable_caravan_unit_ai = true

; In the base game, the AI will assign 1, 2, or 3 escort units to its naval transports and carriers depending in their shield cost and the number of
; units they're carrying. This option lets you reduce the upper limit on the number of escorts assigned. You can limit the number of escorts to 2, 1,
; or even 0. Setting this option >= 3 will result in base game behavior. The purpose of reducing the limit is to free up the AI's naval power units.
max_ai_naval_escorts = 3

; This controls how many workers the AI feels it needs as a percentage of the base amount. For example, if set to 150 (the default), the AI will build
; about 50% more workers than normal. Set to 100 for base game behavior. For more info, see:

[=================]
[=== BUG FIXES ===]
[=================]

; Descriptions of bugs and their fixes:
;   SUBMARINE BUG -- The AI runs into invisible units (such as submarines) belonging to other players because it blindly follows paths produced for
; it by the game's pathfinder, which does not see invisible units. After colliding with an invisible unit, the AI initiates combat, declaring war if
; necessary. The mod fixes this bug by modifying the pathfinder so it sees invisible units belonging to other non-hostile players so it can route
; around them.
;   SCIENCE AGE BUG -- The bonus science points generated by a scientific golden age are not actually counted towards research progress. They appear
; only on the interface. This is because of a small oversight in the code. There is a setting which controls whether or not science age bonus points
; are included while gathering all research points. It's turned off while gathering points to update research progress. The fix is to turn it on.
;   PEDIA TEXTURE BUG -- There is a one pixel wide pink line on the right edge of the Civilopedia screen. This is because the width of the
; Civilopedia background texture is set one pixel too small inside the EXE. This is fixed simply by replacing the width with the correct value.
;   BLOCKED DISEMBARK FREEZE -- When using "disembark all" (which the AI always does) on a boat containing units that can't be disembarked, the game
; may freeze as it endlessly tries to disembark them. The root of the problem is that the game's logic to check if there are any disembarkable units
; left on the boat is incomplete. There are two cases that it misses. First, it does not consider the "immobile" unit flag. This is fixed by making
; immobile units appear to have no remaining movement points for this bit of logic so they are correctly considered non-disembarkable. Second, it does
; not consider escort relationships (e.g. for settlers). If a unit has a non-disembarkable escorter then it also can't be disembarked because the game
; will always try to move its escorter ahead of it. The solution here is to clear all escort relationships for ship passengers before disembarking.
;   HOUSEBOAT BUG -- The game may crash when an AI player is left alive with only a settler on a boat. This happens because the AI's logic tries to
; check the location of its capital city without considering that there may be no capital. The fix is to modify this logic so that when it looks up
; the location of a non-existent capital, it receives a valid "dummy" location that it can process without crashing. See also:

;   https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/c3x-exe-mod-including-bug-fixes-stack-bombard-and-much-more.666881/page-10#post-16085242
;   INTERCEPT LOST TURN BUG -- When a human player sets a fighter to intercept mode, the game discards all of its remaining movement points, hence it
; cannot intercept during the next interturn. This bug does not affect the AI and is part of the interface logic, not the game logic. I presume it was
; inserted by a programmer who did not understand how the game's unit cycling works. The fix simply restores fighters' discarded moves.
;   PHANTOM RESOURCE BUG -- The game only stores one full list of available resources per player. That list contains how many sources of each
; resource type are avaiable in that player's capital and all connected cities. Cities off the capital's network have reduced lists of just 32 bits,
; recording yes-or-no availability for up to 32 resources. Resources beyond the first 32 will share bits in those reduced lists. Specifically, the
; 33rd resource shares the same bit as the 1st, the 34th the same as the 2nd, and so forth. This causes "phantom" resources. For example, if a mod has
; horses set as the 1st resource and steel as the 33rd, then any city off its capital's trade network with access to horses will also have access to
; steel and vice-versa. The fix for this issue is straight forward but not simple. The jist is the mod allocates additional space for the reduced
; lists so they're not limited to 32 bits, rather have enough bits for every resource in the game. After that it's necessary to modify the code that
; accesses the reduced lists so it can make use of the additional space.
;   MAINTENANCE PERSISTING FOR OBSOLETE BUILDINGS -- Players are not supposed to pay maintenance for obsolete city improvements however they often do
; because the game does not recompute maintenance after a player unlocks a technology that obsoletes a city improvement. There is a related exploit in
; that, after triggering a recomputation of maintenance, players can then sell their obsolete buildings to have the maintenance deducted again,
; effectively getting credited for the cost of maintenance. The mod fixes both issues. It recomputes maintenance costs when a player unlocks a
; technology that obsoletes a city improvement and it stops the game from deducting the maintenance cost of an obsolete city imp. when it's sold.
;   BARBARIAN DIAGONAL BUG -- Barbarians can only search for targets on adjacent tiles or on tiles that are up to 12 steps directly SE or NW of their
; position. The intended behavior was for them to search for targets on all surrounding tiles up to 6 steps away. This bug was caused by a small,
; sloppy programming mistake that can be corrected with a small edit. For details, see:
;   https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/c3x-exe-mod-including-bug-fixes-stack-bombard-and-much-more.666881/page-70#post-16434678
;   DISEASE CURING TECH FLAG BUG -- In the base game, the tech flag "Disables Diseases From Flood Plains" (applied to Sanitation) does nothing and
; instead flood plains disease stops once players discover Writing. This happens because that flag is encoded as number 8 and, instead of checking if
; players have a tech with that flag, the code mistakenly checks if players have tech #8, which is Writing under the standard rules. Correcting this
; bug causes a lot more disease, which is a major annoyance, and so this bug fix is turned off by default.
;   DIVISION BY ZERO IN AI ALLIANCE EVAL -- When considering whether to agree to a military alliance, the AI computes the distance from its capital to
; the nearest city belonging to the target of the alliance and divides by that distance. For unknown reasons, in rare cases that distance may be zero,
; which crashes the program due to division by zero. The mod fixes this issue by inserting a bit of logic after the distance is computed to check if
; it's zero and, if so, set it to one.
;   EMPTY ARMY MOVEMENT -- Empty armies have one less than a full move's worth of movement points regardless of how many moves their unit type has set
; in the editor. Under the standard game rules, this means they can only move two tiles along roads. The cause is a small mistake in the logic that
; attempts to find the slowest member among units in the army. The mod fixes this bug by reimplementing the max movement point calculation for armies.
;   PREMATURE TRUNCATION OF FOUND PATHS -- If the game attempts to find a path for a unit that's more than 256 tiles long, the path will not be
; returned properly from the pathfinder. That's because the pathfinder stops reconstructing the final path once it reaches a length of 256. That
; creates a serious problem for long paths because reconstruction works from the end of the path toward the start, so stopping early produces an
; incorrect path that begins in the middle. The fix is simply to multiply the maximum length by 10 (to 2560). Removing the limit entirely risks
; allowing infinite loops. This bug is rarely visible in-game, it usually appears as AI naval units following inappropriate or invalid paths.
;   ZERO PRODUCTION CRASH -- If a city has zero production, which is possible using specialists modded to produce negative shields, the game will
; crash due to a division by zero.
;   AI CAN SACRIFICE WITHOUT SPECIAL ABILITY -- The base game function that gates the AI's ability to sacrifice units does not check whether the unit
; in question has the sacrifice special ability set on its type. Thus, AIs are allowed to sacrifice any captured units as long as they have the
; required tech. The mod fixes this by patching the gating function to insert the missing condition.
;   AI CAN FORM ARMY WITHOUT SPECIAL ABILITY -- Similar to the above issue, the AI's ability to form armies with leader units is not gated by those
; units having the "build army" special ability.
;   CRASH IN LEADER UNIT AI -- The base game's AI routine for leader units may crash due to uninitialized variables.

[=== DISTRICTS ===]
[=================]

; Districts are Civ6-inspired structures built by workers that enable buildings, provide bonuses, and make cities feel more alive. When enabled,
; districts appear on the map and can be required for certain buildings (configured in default.districts_config.txt). Districts occupy tiles within a
; city's work radius, making those tiles unworkable. They can provide bonuses (food, shields, gold, science, culture, defense) to all cities within
; their work radius. If multiple cities share a district, they can optionally share its buildings and wonders (see options below). Districts with
; pollution or enemy units yield no bonuses. Destroyed districts remove dependent buildings from affected cities unless they have another district of
; that type in range. The five district types below can be enabled independently:
;   enable_districts: Enables standard configurable districts (by default: Encampment, Campus, Holy Site, Commercial Hub, Entertainment Complex, Industrial Zone).
;                     Configured is done in default.districts_config.txt, user.districts_config.txt, and scenario.districts_config.txt
;   enable_neighborhood_districts: Enables population growth past a configurable limit (see maximum_pop_before_neighborhood_needed below)
;   enable_wonder_districts: Wonders require a dedicated district tile, making them visible on the map and optionally destructible.
;                            Configured in default.districts_wonders_config.txt, user.districts_wonders_config.txt, and scenario.districts_wonders_config.txt
;   enable_distribution_hub_districts: Special districts that distribute food/shields from surrounding tiles to all connected cities
;   enable_aerodrome_districts: Air units can only be built/based at Aerodrome districts instead of cities (if air_units_use_aerodrome_districts_not_cities is true)
enable_districts = false
enable_neighborhood_districts = false

enable_distribution_hub_districts = false
enable_aerodrome_districts = false
enable_port_districts = false

; When multiple cities share a district (i.e., the same district tile is within multiple cities' work radii), these options control whether those
; cities automatically share the benefits of buildings and wonders constructed in that district. For example, if Rome and Veii both have the same
; Encampment in their work radius and Rome builds a Barracks in that Encampment, enabling cities_with_mutual_district_receive_buildings will cause
; Veii to automatically receive a Barracks as well. Similarly, cities_with_mutual_district_receive_wonders extends this sharing to Great and Small
; Wonders. This encourages strategic district placement between cities and can reduce micromanagement in dense urban areas. 
; Note: receiving buildings is only assessed twice: when a city completes a building, and when a city is founded nearby. A city receiving a building
; cannot in turn recursively share it with third, fourth, fifth, etc. cities in a chain. Only applies if enable_districts is set to true.
cities_with_mutual_district_receive_buildings = true
cities_with_mutual_district_receive_wonders = true

; When enabled, air units can only be built in cities with an Aerodrome district in their work radius and must be based at Aerodrome districts instead
; of cities. Air units will spawn on Aerodromes and can only land on Aerodromes, vanilla airfields, or carriers. Airlifts and airdrops are similarly
; limited to Aerodromes. This adds strategic depth by requiring infrastructure for air power and making air bases visible and vulnerable on the map.
; Only applies when enable_aerodrome_districts is also set to true.
air_units_use_aerodrome_districts_not_cities = true

; Neighborhood district limit population growth. Once a city reaches maximum_pop_before_neighborhood_needed, it cannot
; grow further until it has at least one Neighborhood district in its work radius. Each Neighborhood then enables additional population growth equal to
; per_neighborhood_pop_growth_enabled. For example, with maximum set to 6 and per_neighborhood set to 2, a city can grow to pop 6 without
; Neighborhoods, requires 1 Neighborhood to reach pop 8, requires 2 Neighborhoods to reach pop 10, and so on. Neighborhood bonuses (+1 gold and +1
; culture, by default) only apply if the city actually needs them based on its population. Periodic popups will remind you when a Neighborhood is needed. Only
; applies when enable_neighborhood_districts is set to true.
maximum_pop_before_neighborhood_needed = 6
per_neighborhood_pop_growth_enabled = 3

; These options control the vulnerability and rebuildability of completed Wonders in Wonder districts. When completed_wonder_districts_can_be_destroyed
; is enabled, completed Wonders (both Great and Small) can be pillaged or destroyed by enemies, making them valuable strategic targets that must be
; defended. When destroyed_wonders_can_be_built_again is enabled, destroyed Wonders become available again for any civ to build, putting them back
; into play. Only applies when enable_wonder_districts is set to true.
completed_wonder_districts_can_be_destroyed = true

; Distribution Hubs work as "breadbaskets" and mining areas far from urban centers, minimizing local city potential but benefiting the entire civilization.
; Distribution Hubs make surrounding tiles unworkable and instead distribute their raw food and shield yields to ALL connected cities in your civilization. 
; The divisor settings prevent this from being overpowered by dividing the raw yields before distribution (e.g., with food_divisor = 2, a hub with 10 
; raw food provides 5 food to each connected city). Divisor results are rounded down.
; Distribution Hub yields are subject to corruption as with regular shields. The ai_ideal_distribution_hub_count_per_100_cities setting controls how many 
; Distribution Hubs the AI tries to maintain per 100 cities (e.g., 25 means the AI aims for 1 hub per 4 cities). 
; Only applies when enable_distribution_hub_districts is set to true.
distribution_hub_food_yield_divisor = 3

; When enabled, AI defensive units will actively seek out and defend districts within their territory, treating them as valuable assets like colonies.
; The AI prioritizes defending Wonder districts (if destructible wonders are enabled) over regular districts, searching within a 20-tile radius for
; districts that need protection from nearby enemy units. This makes districts meaningful strategic targets and ensures the AI protects its
; infrastructure. Only applies when enable_districts is set to true.

; When enabled, holding down the Control key while a worker is selected will highlight all tiles within the work radii of nearby cities. City centers
; are highlighted more brightly, while tiles that fall within multiple cities' work radii are highlighted more intensely. This visual aid helps you
; strategically place districts and improvements by showing which cities will be affected. The highlights update dynamically as you move the worker
; around the map. Only applies when enable_districts is set to true.
